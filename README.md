# Graph-D-coloring

This repository contains scripts developed to solve a graph coloring problem using three distinct approaches: exhaustive search, greedy algorithms, and metaheuristics (specifically, a genetic algorithm).

## Contents

- **`checker.cc`**: Validates the correctness of the graph coloring solutions.
- **`color_par.cc`**: Manages parallel processing for coloring algorithms.
- **`exh.cc`**: Implements the exhaustive search algorithm for graph coloring.
- **`exh_cb.cc`**: An alternative version of the exhaustive search algorithm with callback functions.
- **`greedy.cc`**: Contains the greedy algorithm for graph coloring.
- **`mh.cc`**: Implements the metaheuristic approach using a genetic algorithm.
- **`Makefile`**: Facilitates the compilation of the code.
- **`result.txt`**: Stores the results obtained from running the algorithms.
